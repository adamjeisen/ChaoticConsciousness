This repository contains code for computing and generating all the figures for the article "Propofol destabilizes neural dynamics across cortex". All of the data used to generate the figures is attached. To load the data, use `scipy.io.loadmat` to load the relevant figure data file. To maintain clarity about how the figure data was generated, all the figure data save commands (`scipy.io.savemat`) have been left in the code in the appropriate places. Note also that this repo depends on the `DeLASE` repo.

Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions.
